## Overview

Search for profiles in our DataLake using advanced filters. This endpoint allows you to find multiple profiles matching specific criteria from our existing database.

<Note>
  **DataLake Search:** This endpoint searches our existing database with
  historical data. Check the `updateDate` field in each result to see when the
  profile was last refreshed.
</Note>

## 🚀 Need Fresh Data?

The search results include an `updateDate` field showing when each profile was last updated. If the data isn't recent enough for your needs, you can get **live, real-time data** using:

<Card
  title="Person Profile Data"
  icon="user"
  href="/endpoint/v1/person/profile"
>
  Extract fresh profile data directly in real-time from the profile URL.
</Card>

<Tip>
  **Smart Workflow**: Use Person Search to discover candidates, then check the
  `updateDate`. If the data is recent enough (e.g., within last 30 days), use it
  directly. If not, fetch fresh data using Person Profile Data for critical
  contacts.
</Tip>

| `pagination` | object | Pagination information (see below) |
| `metadata` | object | Metadata about the response (see below) |

### Pagination Object

| `currentPage` | integer | Current page number |
| `totalPages` | integer | Total number of pages available |
| `totalResults` | integer | Total number of results matching the query |

## Best Practices

### Efficient Searching

- **Be specific**: Use multiple filters to narrow down results and improve relevance
  {/* - **Monitor costs**: Each page costs 0.10 credits (20 results per page). Accessing multiple pages will consume additional credits. */}
- **Check data freshness**: Always review the `updateDate` field. For time-sensitive use cases, consider refreshing older profiles with live scraping.

### Hybrid Approach: Search + Live Enrichment

Maximize efficiency and accuracy with this workflow:

1. **Search** - Use this endpoint to find relevant profiles {/* at 0.10 credits per page */}
2. **Filter** - Review the `updateDate` to identify which profiles need refreshing
3. **Enrich** - Use [Person Profile Data](/endpoint/v1/person/profile) to get the freshest data for the profiles you need

{/* prettier-ignore */}
{/*
**Example Cost Comparison:**

- Search 100 profiles (5 pages): **0.50 credits**
- Live-scrape all 100 profiles: **100 credits** 💸
- **Smart approach**: Search 100 + refresh 10 most important: **0.50 + 10 = 10.50 credits** ✅

This hybrid approach saves up to 90% on credits while maintaining data quality where it matters most!

{/* ## Credit Consumption

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Per Page" icon="coins">
    **0.10 credits** per page (maximum 20 results per page)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
*/}

{/* prettier-ignore */}
{/*<Tip>
Cost-effective for finding multiple profiles. Each page costs 0.10 credits
regardless of the number of results (up to 20). Use pagination wisely to
manage your credit consumption.

</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Fetching multiple pages will consume 0.10 credits per page. For
  example, accessing pages 1, 2, and 3 will cost 0.30 credits total (3 pages ×
  0.10 credits).
</Warning>
