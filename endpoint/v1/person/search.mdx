## Best Practices

### Efficient Searching

- **Be specific**: Use multiple filters to narrow down results and improve relevance
- **Monitor costs**: Each search costs 0.10 credits regardless of results count

## Credit Consumption

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Per Search" icon="coins">
    **0.10 credits** per search request (regardless of the number of results)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  This is the most cost-effective way to find multiple profiles. Unlike
  individual profile enrichment, you pay a flat rate per search, not per result.
