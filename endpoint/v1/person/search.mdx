## Best Practices

### Efficient Searching

- **Be specific**: Use multiple filters to narrow down results and improve relevance
- **Monitor costs**: Each page costs 0.10 credits (20 results per page). Accessing multiple pages will consume additional credits.

## Credit Consumption

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Per Page" icon="coins">
    **0.10 credits** per page (maximum 20 results per page)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Cost-effective for finding multiple profiles. Each page costs 0.10 credits
  regardless of the number of results (up to 20). Use pagination wisely to
  manage your credit consumption.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Fetching multiple pages will consume 0.10 credits per page. For
  example, accessing pages 1, 2, and 3 will cost 0.30 credits total (3 pages ×
  0.10 credits).
</Warning>
