## Overview

Search for profiles in our DataLake using advanced filters. This endpoint allows you to find multiple profiles matching specific criteria from our existing database.

<Note>
  **DataLake Search:** This endpoint searches our existing database with
  historical data. Check the `updateDate` field in each result to see when the
  profile was last refreshed.
</Note>

## 🚀 Need Fresh Data?

The search results include an `updateDate` field showing when each profile was last updated. If the data isn't recent enough for your needs, you can get **live, real-time data** using:

<Card
  title="Person Profile Data"
  icon="user"
  href="/endpoint/v1/person/profile"
>
  Extract fresh profile data directly in real-time from the profile URL.
</Card>

<Tip>
  **Smart Workflow**: Use Person Search to discover candidates, then check the
  `updateDate`. If the data is recent enough (e.g., within last 30 days), use it
  directly. If not, fetch fresh data using Person Profile Data for critical
  contacts.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Efficient Searching

- **Be specific**: Use multiple filters to narrow down results and improve relevance
- **Monitor costs**: Each page costs 0.10 credits (20 results per page). Accessing multiple pages will consume additional credits.
- **Check data freshness**: Always review the `updateDate` field. For time-sensitive use cases, consider refreshing older profiles with live scraping.

### Hybrid Approach: Search + Live Enrichment

Maximize efficiency and accuracy with this workflow:

1. **Search** - Use this endpoint to find relevant profiles {/* at 0.10 credits per page */}
2. **Filter** - Review the `updateDate` to identify which profiles need refreshing
3. **Enrich** - Use [Person Profile Data](/endpoint/v1/person/profile) to get the freshest data for the profiles you need

## Credit Consumption

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Per Page" icon="coins">
    **0.10 credits** per page (maximum 20 results per page)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Cost-effective for finding multiple profiles. Each page costs 0.10 credits
  regardless of the number of results (up to 20). Use pagination wisely to
  manage your credit consumption.
