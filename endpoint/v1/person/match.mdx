  **Caching Available:** Use the optional `cacheDuration` parameter to enable
  caching and reduce costs. Cache hits consume only **0.5 credits** instead of 1
  credit. See the request parameters below for details.

## How Caching Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cache Hit" icon="bolt">
    If we find the profile in our cache within your specified duration, we serve
    it instantly at **0.5 credits**. This is a 50% savings on the standard
    price.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cache Miss" icon="arrows-rotate">
    If the profile isn't cached, we perform a **live scrape** to get fresh data.
    This costs the standard **1 credit**.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Complete History:** The `positionHistory`, `educationHistory`, and `certificationHistory` fields return all positions, education entries, and certifications available on the profile.
