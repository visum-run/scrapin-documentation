## Overview

Search for companies in our DataLake using advanced filters. This endpoint allows you to find multiple companies matching specific criteria from our existing database.

<Note>
  **DataLake Search:** This endpoint searches our existing database with
  historical data.
</Note>

## Need Fresh Data?

If you can't find companies recent enough even with the `updateDate` filter, you can get **live, real-time data** using:

<Card
  title="Company Profile Data"
  icon="building"
  href="/endpoint/v1/company/extract-profile"
>
  Extract fresh company data directly in real-time from the company LinkedIn URL.
</Card>

<Tip>
  **Smart Workflow**: Use Company Search with the `updateDate` filter to discover
  companies with recent data. For critical targets that need the freshest data,
  fetch live data using Company Profile Data.
</Tip>

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Market Research">
    Search for companies by name and industry:
    ```json
    {
      "companyName": "Tech",
      "industry": ["Software Development"]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Competitor Analysis">
    Find competitors in a specific industry and country:
    ```json
    {
      "industry": ["Software Development", "IT Services and IT Consulting"],
      "locationCountryCode": "US"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Find Companies by Size">
    Target mid-sized companies with employee count filters:
    ```json
    {
      "employeeCountMin": 50,
      "employeeCountMax": 500
    }
    ```
    This example finds biotech companies with 50-500 employees. You can use either parameter alone or both together.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Geographic Targeting">
    Find companies headquartered in a specific city and country:
    ```json
    {
      "locationCity": "San Francisco",
      "locationCountryCode": "US"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Industry Analysis">
    Discover all companies in one or more industries. Use an array for multiple industries:
    ```json
    {
      "industry": ["Software Development", "IT Services and IT Consulting"]
    }
    ```
    <Note>
      The complete list of available industries can be found in the Scrapin application.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  For fresher data, use the [Company Profile
  Data](/endpoint/v1/company/extract-profile) endpoint.
</Note>

## Best Practices

### Efficient Searching

- **Be specific**: Use multiple filters to narrow down results and improve relevance
- **Monitor costs**: Each page costs 0.10 credits (20 results per page). Accessing multiple pages will consume additional credits.
- **Filter by freshness**: Use the `updateDate` parameter to only retrieve companies updated within your required time frame (e.g., `"updateDate": "30d"` for last 30 days).

### Hybrid Approach: Search + Live Enrichment

Maximize efficiency and accuracy with this workflow:

1. **Search** - Use this endpoint with the `updateDate` filter to find relevant companies with recent data
2. **Review** - Check if the returned companies meet your requirements
3. **Enrich** - Use [Company Profile Data](/endpoint/v1/company/extract-profile) only for companies that need fresher data

## Credit Consumption

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Per Page" icon="coins">
    **0.10 credits** per page (maximum 20 results per page)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Cost-effective for finding multiple companies. Each page costs 0.10 credits
  regardless of the number of results (up to 20). Use pagination wisely to
  manage your credit consumption.
